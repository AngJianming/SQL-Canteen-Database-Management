## Canteen Database Management system and automation

The __Canteen Database Management__ system and automation is a SQL-based project that simplifies and organizes the management of canteen operations. This system allows canteen staff to track and manage food items, orders, customers, payments and food rating. The database ensures smooth transactions and an organized inventory, providing real-time insights into day-to-day operations.
